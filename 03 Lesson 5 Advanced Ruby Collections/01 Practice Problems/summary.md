# Summary

The assignments in this lesson have built on and combined a number of different concepts covered in previous lessons. Completing the assignments in this lesson should provide you with the understanding required to work with complex nested collections using iterative methods combined with blocks.

Some important points to remember:

- You should know how to reference items within nested collections in order to manipulate them.

- You should be aware that when you make a copy of a collection object that it is a shallow copy - the objects within the collections are shared between the copy and the original.

- When working with blocks, especially when using nested collections:

  - Take the time to break down and understand the structure of a collection.
  - Choose an appropriate method and be clear on its implementation and return value.
  - Understand what is being returned by the various methods and blocks at each level. When iterating through nested collections, be particularly aware of the return value of the block and any side effects of the code within the block.
  - The purpose of exposing you to these concepts and techniques at this stage is to provide you with the tools necessary to solve coding problems which might require you to work with nested collections as part of the solution. Being able to manipulate a collection of data is very often a necessary component of a solution to an overall coding problem.

Using what you have learned in this lesson you should now be able to isolate and solve such components when you identify them as part of a larger problem. The ultimate goal is to give you the ability to analyze code and understand it completely and with confidence. You should know exactly what each line of code is doing, and understand exactly why your code behaves the way it does.

The next step, before moving on to the following lesson, is to complete the quiz for this lesson. We've covered a few advanced concepts here, so don't be afraid to take your time with these questions and refer back to the material if necessary.
