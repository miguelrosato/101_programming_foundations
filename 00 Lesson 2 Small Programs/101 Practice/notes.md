## Focus will be on preparation to written Assessment

- 20 Questions
- 3 Hours to answer all of the question
- The biggest difficulty is the time.
  - Requires a lot of detailed writing
  - No time to review
  - No Coding problems
- The typical question has some code and I have to explain code behavior

## Interview

- Normally two problems that I will have to code directly (using PEDAC)
- Requires to explain the thought process while coding
- Figuring out the algorithm will be difficult
- Much more difficult than written assessment
- Normally between 40 minutes to one hour maximum time for interview. Preferred no more than 40 minutes.
- Try to write pseudo-code and focus on learning PEDAC technique in Lesson 4
  - Focus on explaining first through PEDAC
  - No need to pseudo-code, however is helpful
  - Code when absolutely clear on algorithm.
