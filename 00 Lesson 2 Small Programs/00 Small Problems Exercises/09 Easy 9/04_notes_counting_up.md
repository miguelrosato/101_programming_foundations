## 4.- Counting Up

## Problem Enunciate
Write a method that takes an integer argument, and returns an Array of all integers, in sequence, between 1 and the argument.

You may assume that the argument will always be a valid integer that is greater than 0.

## Understanding the Problem:

input: An integer
output: An array of all the integers counting up to the value.


## Examples / test cases:

```ruby
sequence(5) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sequence(3) == [1, 2, 3]
sequence(1) == [1]
```

## Data. Data Structure

Create an array, and use the integer value to map the sum of all the integers from 1 to the value.

We can also use directly an iterator and the to_a method directly.
