## 8.- Multiply List

## Problem Enunciate
Write a method that takes two Array arguments in which each Array contains a list of numbers, and returns a new Array that contains the product of each pair of numbers from the arguments that have the same index. You may assume that the arguments contain the same number of elements.

## Understanding the Problem:

input: Two arrays of n elements
output: An array on which each element is the result of the multiplication of the two elements of the previous arrays with the same index


## Examples / test cases:

```ruby
multiply_list([3, 5, 7], [9, 10, 11]) == [27, 50, 77]
```

## Data. Data Structure

The array each_with_index and map method could be used to iterate over the initial array while multiplying against each element of the second array
