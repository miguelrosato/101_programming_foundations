## 10.- Right Triangles

## Problem Enunciate

Write a method that takes a positive integer, n, as an argument, and displays a right triangle whose sides each have n stars. The hypotenuse of the triangle (the diagonal side in the images below) should have one end at the lower-left of the triangle, and the other end at the upper-right.



## Understanding the Problem:

Input: an integer `n`
Output: an `n` number of lines, that includes `n..1` number of spaces and `1..n` numbers of `*` symbols

## Examples / test cases:
``` ruby
triangle(5)

    *
   **
  ***
 ****
*****

triangle(9)

        *
       **
      ***
     ****
    *****
   ******
  *******
 ********
*********
```

## Data. Data Structure
mae an iterator that add the spaces in a string, and then add the `*` on the same string. Print the value at each iteration


## Algorithm:
