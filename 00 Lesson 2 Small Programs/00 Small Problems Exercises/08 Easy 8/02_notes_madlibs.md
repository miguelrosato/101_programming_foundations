## 2.- Madlibs

## Problem Enunciate
Mad libs are a simple game where you create a story template with blanks for words. You, or another player, then construct a list of words and place them into the story, creating an often silly or funny story as a result.

Create a simple mad-lib program that prompts for a noun, a verb, an adverb, and an adjective and injects those into a story that you create.


## Understanding the Problem:

input: a series of promts to introduce a noun, then a verb, then an adverb, and finally an adjective and inject those into a history created by the programmer. 
output: A string composed by the story, with the words introduced by the user.


## Examples / test cases:

```ruby
Enter a noun: dog
Enter a verb: walk
Enter an adjective: blue
Enter an adverb: quickly

Do you walk your blue dog quickly? That's hilarious!
```

## Data. Data Structure

Create variables noun, verb, adjective and adverb and save them using gets.chomp. then incorporate them into the story string using #{}
