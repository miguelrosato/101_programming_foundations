## 10.- Middle Character

## Problem Enunciate
Write a method that takes a non-empty string argument, and returns the middle character or characters of the argument. If the argument has an odd length, you should return exactly one character. If the argument has an even length, you should return exactly two characters.

## Understanding the Problem:

input: Non Empty String
output: A string representative of the middle character of the initial string (if the initial string number of characters is odd) and the two middle characters (if the initial string number of characters is even)


## Examples / test cases:

```ruby
center_of('I love ruby') == 'e'
center_of('Launch School') == ' '
center_of('Launch') == 'un'
center_of('Launchschool') == 'hs'
center_of('x') == 'x'
```

## Data. Data Structure

Count the number of characters of the string. If the string size is odd? then print the middle character, if it is even, then print the two middle characters.
