# Question 6
# Starting with the string:

famous_words = "seven years ago..."

# show two different ways to put the expected "Four score and " in front of it.

first_part = "Four score and "

# complete_sentence = first_part + famous_words

# complete_sentence2 = "#{first_part}#{famous_words}"

# complete_sentence3 = famous_words.prepend("Four score and ")

# complete_sentence4 = first_part << famous_words

complete_sentence5 = famous_words.prepend(first_part)


# p complete_sentence
# p complete_sentence2
# p complete_sentence3
# p complete_sentence4
 p complete_sentence5
