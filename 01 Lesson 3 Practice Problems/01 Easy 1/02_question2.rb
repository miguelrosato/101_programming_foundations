# Lesson 3: Practice Problems
# Easy 1
# Question 2
# Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:

# ! and ? at the end of a method name, are part of the method name, 
# and they are not Ruby syntax. 

# As part of the Ruby syntax, the bank symbol ! is used mostly to negate things
# As part of the Ruby syntax, the interrogation symbol ? is used mostly to 
# compare values

# what is != and where should you use it?
# Is the not equal symbol. It is used in comparison to sy that a value is not 
# equal to another
# put ! before something, like !user_name
# ! is used to obtain the boolean equivalen of the opposite value. 
# For example, since the number 3 is thruty, !3 will return false
# put ! after something, like words.uniq!
# In This case, the ! symbol is part of the uniq! name method
# put ? before something
# ? Is the ternary operator. It will verify if a condition is tru
# put ? after something
# It is used as method name
# put !! before something, like !!user_name
# Turns the object into its boolean equivalent !!3 will become true
