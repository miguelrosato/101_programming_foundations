At this point, you should have learned to:

- build slightly more complex programs
- be able to map out logic and flow for a more complex program
- learn to hold code and application logic in your head
- isolate code into reasonable "chunks" and extract to methods
- write methods that have one single responsibility, and are easy to use
- be intimately familiar with variable scoping rules
- be able to determine when an object is permanently modified when passed into a method
- debug a complex program, using various techniques and tools (especially pry)
- feel more comfortable with pure Ruby
- feel more comfortable with tearing down a seemingly complex problem
- search for answers online
- experiment in irb or a code editor

While you were building the programs, you should have also experienced some frustrations:

- one little change in one place caused a ripple effect throughout the program
- hard to load an entire program in your head at once
- adding a feature requires major surgery to the entire program
- lack of guidelines to organize or break down the program into appropriate chunks
- All this should have prepared you for the next step, which is learning about Object Oriented Programming. OOP will help - - alleviate many of these frustrations, but it introduces more complexity and some new concepts. Be prepared, it's a completely different way to think about programming.

Before moving on to OOP though, there's one more quiz for this course. Use this quiz as a way of checking your understanding of some of the concepts covered in this lesson.
