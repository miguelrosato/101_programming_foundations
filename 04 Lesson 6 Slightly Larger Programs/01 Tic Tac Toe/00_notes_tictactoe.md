# Lesson 6. Slightly Larger Programs. Tic Tac Toe

## Problem Enunciate

We want to build a single player Tic Tac Toe game where a user can play against the computer.

Tic Tac Toe is a 2 player game played on a 3x3 board. Each player takes a turn and
marks a square on the board. First player to reach 3 squares in a row, including diagonals,
wins. If all 9 squares are marked and no player has 3 squares in a row, then the game is a tie.

## High Order Pseudocode

1. Display the initial empty 3x3 board.
2. Ask the user to mark a square.
3. Computer marks a square.
4. Display the updated board state.
5. If winner, display winner.
6. If board is full, display tie.
7. If neither winner nor board is full, go to #2
8. Play again?
9. If yes, go to #1
10. Good bye!

## Notes Regarding the `detect_winner(brd)` method

Initially we use this code:
```ruby

INITIAL_MARKER = " ".freeze
PLAYER_MARKER = "X".freeze
COMPUTER_MARKER = "O".freeze
WINNING_LINES = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]] + # Rows
                [[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]] + # Columns
                [[1, 5, 9], [3, 5, 7]]              # Diagonals

def detect_winner(brd)
  WINNING_LINES.each do |line|
    if brd[line[0]] == PLAYER_MARKER &&
       brd[line[1]] == PLAYER_MARKER &&
       brd[line[2]] == PLAYER_MARKER
      return "Player"
    elsif brd[line[0]] == COMPUTER_MARKER &&
          brd[line[1]] == COMPUTER_MARKER &&
          brd[line[2]] == COMPUTER_MARKER
      return "Computer"
    end
  end
  nil
end
```

This method is repetitive, and does not take advantage of the hash methods available. It can be re-written as follows:

```ruby
def detect_winner(brd)
  WINNING_LINES.each do |line|
    if brd.values_at(line[0], line[1], line[2]).count(PLAYER_MARKER) == 3
      return "Player"
    elsif brd.values_at(line[0], line[1], line[2]).count(COMPUTER_MARKER) == 3
      return "Computer"
    end
  end
  nil
end
```

Also, since we are passing all the elements of the line sub-array we can simplify the code as follows:

```ruby
def detect_winner(brd)
  WINNING_LINES.each do |line|
    if brd.values_at(*line).count(PLAYER_MARKER) == 3
      return "Player"
    elsif brd.values_at(*line).count(COMPUTER_MARKER) == 3
      return "Computer"
    end
  end
  nil
end
```

Finally, we can refactor the whole method using guard clauses as follows:

```ruby
def detect_winner(brd)
  WINNING_LINES.each do |line|
    return "Player" if brd.values_at(*line).count(PLAYER_MARKER) == 3
    return "Computer" if brd.values_at(*line).count(COMPUTER_MARKER) == 3
  end
  nil
end
```


## 1. Joinor Method

## Problem Enunciate

If we run the current game, we'll see the following prompt:

=> Choose a position to place a piece: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
This is ok, but we'd like for this message to read a little better. We want to separate the last item with a "or", so that it reads:

=> Choose a position to place a piece: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9
Currently, we're using the Array#join method, which can only insert a delimiter between the array elements, and isn't smart enough to display a joining word for the last element.

Write a method called joinor that will produce the following result:

```ruby
joinor([1, 2])                   # => "1 or 2"
joinor([1, 2, 3])                # => "1, 2, or 3"
joinor([1, 2, 3], '; ')          # => "1; 2; or 3"
joinor([1, 2, 3], ', ', 'and')   # => "1, 2, and 3"
```
Then, use this method in the TTT game when prompting the user to mark a square.


## Understanding the Problem:

input: An array and two default strings
output: A string that joins the array with the default parameters.

## Examples / test cases:

```ruby
joinor([1, 2])                   # => "1 or 2"
joinor([1, 2, 3])                # => "1, 2, or 3"
joinor([1, 2, 3], '; ')          # => "1; 2; or 3"
joinor([1, 2, 3], ', ', 'and')   # => "1, 2, and 3"
```

## Data. Data Structure

Iterate over the array, using the next special word and unless conditional at the iteration of the array[-2] element. This will allow to add the default strings to the array and then finalise iterating.
